## Project Description

This project is a multi-page web form designed for a Business Analytics Student Survey. It spans several HTML pages, guiding users through a series of questions from basic demographic information to specific course completions and perceptions of their major, conluding in a thank you message upon submission.

## Best Practices for Forms

Regarding best practices for forms, this project adheres to several key principles to enhance user experience and data quality. Clarity and context are provided in each question, ensuring the purpose of the survey is well-defined from the beginning. The use of tooltips, such as explaining the relevance of gender identification, provides additional context without cluttering the interface. This approach adheres to best practices of keeping forms simple yet informative.

Progressive disclosure is utilized by splitting the survey across multiple pages, with a clear indication of progress. This reduces cognitive load on the user by not presenting too much information at once. Additionally, required fields are marked, and the use of HTML5 validation ensures that necessary data is collected before proceeding. The form's responsive design ensures accessibility across a wide range of devices.

## Accessibility Considerations

For accessibility specifically, the project implements several strategies to make the web forms accessible to all users. The forms use `aria-label` attributes extensively, ensuring that users relying on assistive technologies can navigate and interact with the form effectively. The structure of the form allows for easy navigation using keyboard shortcuts, crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. The final page provides users with a clear message that their responses have been saved, a critical aspect of accessibility. This ensures that all users, regardless of their ability to visually confirm the submission through traditional cues, receive confirmation that their participation has been successfully recorded.

In summary, the survey's design incorporates best practices for web forms by focusing on clarity, context, accessibility, and user experience, ensuring that it is both usable and accessible to a broad audience.
